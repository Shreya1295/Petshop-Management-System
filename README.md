Our project makes use of an efficient and innovative method for booking different services for your pet at the pet shop. This is primarily aimed at designing a windows application which can be installed by anyone.
The project is coded in Python and run locally as tkinter app with the backend connected using SQLite3.
Our Database Management System primarily offers three main services:
-Book a new appointment
-Update an already booked appointment
-Display the details of an already booked appointment
